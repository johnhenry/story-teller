# Instructions

Write a middle page of a story, ensuring it serves as a bridge between the Previous Part and the Next Part. Use the cues from both to maintain continuity in character development, plot progression, and thematic elements.

Include ONLY the text of the story. Do not ask questions. Do not seek clarification. Do not add external commentary. If you are unsure about something, just make it up. Do not indicate that your are ready to start writing -- just start writing.
